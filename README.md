# Exploding Kitten Game
The Exploding Kitten game was developed using Java, following modern software quality engineering practices to ensure a high-quality and maintainable application. The development process incorporated test-driven development, boundary value analysis, and automated testing frameworks to create robust unit and GUI tests. Mocking was utilized to design effective unit and integration tests, while code quality was enhanced through formal code reviews, adherence to coding standards, and the application of design principles from Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship by Robert C. Martin. A CI/CD pipeline was implemented alongside Git version control, build tools, and linters to streamline development and ensure reliable product delivery. Additionally, the game was designed with global usability in mind, incorporating software internationalization to accommodate diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds. These practices resulted in a well-structured, functional, and globally accessible application.
